GeoQAV2 (Template-Based Geospatial Question Answering)

This contains all the Qanary components to build GeoQAV2 (Template-Based Geospatial Question Answering)

How to run the code Without docker Clone the GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/dharmenpunjani/GeoQAV2

Install Java 8 (see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html for details)

Install maven (see https://maven.apache.org/install.html for details)

Compile and package your project using maven: mvn clean install -DskipDockerBuild The install goal will compile, test, and package your projectâ€™s code and then copy it into the local dependency repository.

Install Stardog Triplestore (http://stardog.com/) and start it in background. Create a database with the name qanary. All the triples generated by the components will be stored in the qanary database. We use version 6.0.0 of Stardog.

Run the pipeline component:

Example 1. cd qanary_pipeline-template/target/ java -jar target/qa.pipeline-.jar After maven build jar files will be generated in the corresponding folders of the Qanary components. For example, to start the Alchemy API components:

Example 1. cd qanary_component-TagMeDisambiguateYago java -jar target/TagMeDisambiguate.jar After running corresponding jar files, you can see Springboot application running on http://localhost:12345/#/overview that will tell the status of currently running components.

The port 12345 can be set to any other port of your choice in application.properties file.

As shown above to run GeoQAV2 you should run the following components to run complete pipeline - qanary_pipeline-template - qanary_component-TagMeDisambiguateYago -  - qanary_component-geospatial-conceptidentifier - qanary_component-geospatial-RelationDetection - qanary_component-PropertyIdentifierYago - qanary_component-geospatial-GeoSparqlGenerator - qanary_component-geospatial-GeoSparqlExecuter

Now your pipeline is ready to use. Go to http://localhost:12345/startquestionansweringwithtextquestion. Here you can find a User Interface to interact for adding question via web interface, and then select the components you need to include in the pipeline via checking a checkbox for each component. Press the start button and you are ready to go!
